# StudyCircle User Guide

StudyCircle (SC) is a **desktop app for *NUS computing students* that helps you keep track of your project groups.** It helps you manage your contacts, sort them into groups, and track events within those groups.<br>
SC is optimised for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still allowing you to see your changes in real time through a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, SC can get your contact and group management tasks done faster than traditional GUI-only apps.

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `17` or above installed in your Computer.<br>
   **Mac users:** Ensure you have the precise JDK version prescribed [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationMac.html).

1. Download the latest `.jar` file from [here](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-F12-1/tp/releases).

1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your StudyCircle.

1. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar StudyCircle.jar` 
   command to run the application.<br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. The main elements of the interface have been highlighted in the screenshot. Note how the app contains some sample data to help you get oriented.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui_withLabel.png)

1. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * `list-contacts` : Lists all contacts.

   * `add-contact n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com` : Adds a contact named `John Doe` to the contact list.

   * `delete-contact 3` : Deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current contact list.

   * `clear` : Deletes all contacts and groups.

   * `exit` : Exits the app.

1. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

## Features

<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add-contact n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [g/GROUP_INDEX]` can be used as `n/John Doe g/1` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[g/GROUP_INDEX]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `g/1`, `g/2 g/3` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list-contacts`, 
  `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

* All commands are case sensitive. <br>
  e.g. `list-contacts` is not the same as `List-Contacts`

welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<box type="warning" seamless>

**Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, StudyCircle will discard all data and start with an empty 
data file at the next run.  Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause StudyCIrcle to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside the

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that 
contains the data of your previous StudyCircle home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues
1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **When resizing the window of StudyCircle**, if the window gets too small and the description of a group's 
   event or member name is too long, it will cause the box displaying that group to stop automatically resizing. 
   This leads to the need to use a scroll bar to scroll through that group's events/members if there are too many 
   items in either category.
3. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the help command (or use the Help menu, or the keyboard shortcut F1) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
